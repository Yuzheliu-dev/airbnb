## Accessibility Practices

1. **Semantic Structure**  
   - All clickable interactions use `<button>` / `<a>` elements. Navigation buttons in `AppRouter` include `aria-label` attributes (e.g., “Go to hosted listings”) to ensure screen readers convey the intended purpose.  
   - Primary content (e.g., listing pages, hosted pages) resides within `<main>`, while header navigation is placed in `<header>` for rapid assistive technology navigation.

2. **Form Accessibility**  
   - All input fields for login, registration, property creation/editing, and booking are wrapped in `<label>`. `LoginPage` and `RegisterPage` additionally include `data-testid` for accessibility testing.  
   - Form errors display inline on the page (e.g., mismatched passwords, missing dates), while `ErrorNotification` elements with `role=“alert”` ensure screen readers announce them immediately.

3. **Visuals and Feedback**  
   - Color schemes follow high-contrast principles (dark text on light backgrounds). Buttons show distinct visual changes on hover and when disabled.  
   - Use `SuccessNotification` (`role=“status”`) to indicate status after login/registration/form submission, avoiding `alert()`.

4. **Keyboard & Focus Management**  
   - Components retain browser default `tabIndex` order; notification panels allow tab focus to close buttons.  
   - Use native `<input type="date/number">` for availability management, booking panels, etc., ensuring keyboard navigation aligns with screen reader descriptions.
